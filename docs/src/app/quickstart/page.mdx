# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use Netgoat in Reverse Proxy mode or DNS Mode

## Choose your mode

Before you can start using Netgoat CE (Community Edition), you will need to select a mode of operations, which is either Reverse Proxy mode or DNS Mode. Each mode has its own setup and configuration steps. Depending on resources and usage type it will vary if you plan to use with cloudflare go for reverse proxy for standalone and more features go with DNS Mode.

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Protocol API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Conversations endpoint to get a list of all your conversations. In the cURL example, results are limited to ten conversations, the default page length for each client.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/conversations">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -d limit=10
```

```js
import ApiClient from '@example/protocol-api'

const client = new ApiClient(token)

await client.conversations.list()
```

```python
from protocol_api import ApiClient

client = ApiClient(token)

client.conversations.list()
```

```php
$client = new \Protocol\ApiClient($token);

$client->conversations->list();
```

</CodeGroup>

  <Button href="/conversations" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>Read the docs for the Conversations endpoint</>
  </Button>
</div>
